# Rules #
* Battleships is a simple guessing game for two players.
* The game is played on four 10 X 10 grids, two for each player.
* On one of the grid you assemble your battleships horizontally and vertically however you want without stacking them. Ships cannot be diagonal.
* With the other grid you take turns guessing where the other player's ships are located on the board.
* You get only one guess per turn then it becomes the other player's turn. 
* Once a ship has been hit on all grids it occupies it is sunk.
* You cannot do anything when it is not your turn.
* You cannot see where the other player places their ships or if their ship is sunk.
* Once all a player's ships have been found and sunk they lose and the opponent wins.

## Game decides who goes first ##
The game will pick which player will have their turn first randomly.
